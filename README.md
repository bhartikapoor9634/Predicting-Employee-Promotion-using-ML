# Predicting-Employee-Promotion-using-ML

In this project, the aim is to predict if the employee will get promotion or not using historical data taken from Kaggle. 
In this work, various python visualisation libraries have been used to analyse the dataset. 
Different supervised ML techniques have been used to implement the classifier- Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machines, and XG Boost.
The performance of the models have been compared using Confusion Matrix and Classification Report. It was observed that the maximum accuracy was obtained using Random Forest Classifier which is 95%.
